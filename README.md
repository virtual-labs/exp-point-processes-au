### About the Experiment 

"The experiment "Time-Frequency Analysis of Bio-signals" introduces methods to analyze non-stationary biomedical signals, such as ECG or EEG, using time-frequency techniques like the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) and Wavelet Transform. This helps visualize how signal frequency content evolves over time, providing deeper insights into physiological processes and abnormalities."
