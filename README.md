### About the Experiment 

The "Point Processes and Models" experiment introduces learners to stochastic models used to represent random events distributed in time or space. It focuses on fundamental concepts like the Poisson process and its variants, enabling users to simulate and analyze real-world phenomena such as neuron spike trains, traffic flow, or communication signals. This experiment helps build intuition about the probabilistic structure and behavior of point processes through interactive visualizations and hands-on simulations.
